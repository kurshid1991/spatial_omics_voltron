# Code Explanation

## 1. Setup and Importing Data

```r
install.packages("VoltRon")
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx8g")
library(VoltRon)

```
- Install Voltron.
- Allocates 8 GB of RAM for Java operations (often used for memory-intensive data processing).
- Loads the VoltRon package for spatial transcriptomics and spatial omics data analysis.

## 2. Creating and Exploring VoltRon Objects

```r
  ####
# VoltRon object ####
####

# import data
data("merged_object")

# object
merged_object
```
- Loads a sample dataset named merged_object, which is likely a multi-omics data object.
- Displays the object to inspect its structure.

**Output:**

merged_object

VoltRon Object 

Block: 

      Layers: Section1 Section2 Section3 
    Assays: CellAssay(Main) MolAssay ROIAssay 
    Features: main(Main) 

This output describes a VoltRon Object named merged_object. Here's what it means:

#### Block:

  The object contains spatial data organized into blocks or sections.
In this case, there are three layers: Section1, Section2, and Section3. Each section represents a spatial region or experimental block.
#### Assays:

- CellAssay (Main) – The primary assay containing cell-level data.
- MolAssay – Contains molecular data, possibly representing gene expression or protein data.
- ROIAssay – Represents region-of-interest (ROI) data, often used for segmenting specific areas of images.

#### Features:

The primary feature set is marked as main (Main).
Features generally include genes, proteins, or other molecular markers detected in the assays.
This structure is typical for spatial omics datasets where multiple data types (cellular, molecular, and ROI-level) are analyzed together.



 ```r
SampleMetadata(merged_object)
```
`SampleMetadata()` provides sample-level information like sample names, treatments, or conditions.

**Output**

| Assay   | Layer      | Sample |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Assay1   | CellAssay  | Section1 | Block |
| Assay2   | MolAssay   | Section2 | Block |
| Assay3   | ROIAssay   | Section3 | Block |
| Assay4   | MolAssay   | Section1 | Block |
| Assay5   | ROIAssay   | Section1 | Block |

This table provides an overview of the sample metadata within the `merged_object`.  
- **Assay**: Represents the type of analysis performed.  
- **Layer**: Specifies the data layer, including cell-level, molecular, or region-of-interest (ROI) data.  
- **Sample**: Indicates the section or block from which the data was collected.

```r
Metadata(merged_object)
```
`Metadata()` extracts object-level metadata, including experiment details.

**Output:**

| 171_Assay1   | 241   | Assay1   | CellAssay | Section1  | Block    | 1        | 171   |
| 180_Assay1   | 91    | Assay1   | CellAssay | Section1  | Block    | 2        | 180   |
| 182_Assay1   | 113   | Assay1   | CellAssay | Section1  | Block    | 3        | 182   |
| ...           | ...   | ...      | ...       | ...        | ...      | ...      | ...   |
| 1110_Assay1 | 140   | Assay1   | CellAssay | Section1  | Block    | 3        | 1110  |
| 1120_Assay1 | 217   | Assay1   | CellAssay | Section1  | Block    | 1        | 1120  |

This table shows a subset of the data from `Assay1` in the `merged_object`.

**Note:**  
- The table is truncated for readability. There are **2064 more rows** not shown in this view.  
- The **Count** column represents the number of observations or measurements.  
- The **Clusters** column indicates cluster assignments, potentially derived from a clustering algorithm.  
- The **ID.1** column is a numeric version of the ID.
